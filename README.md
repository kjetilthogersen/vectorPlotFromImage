# vectorPlotFromImage
Return vectorized line plot from 2D image with simple thresholding. Intended for use in creating meshes for FEM simulations from binary images. I have also used this to generate vector images for creating microfluidic chips.

Matlab implementation

run.m contains a simple example using fracture_network.png to create a vectorplot.
